Monte-Carlo Glauber Model of Heavy Ion Collisions

Python based collision simulator for heavy ions. 
Utilizes Monte-Carlo Glauber methods to geometrically simulate 
nuclear collisions.

GlauberModel.py requires 
* WoodSaxonParameters.txt
* FourierBesselParameters.txt
* and working internet connection to run

Follow the steps outlined in the MCGlauber.ipynb notebook file.
